# BananaEndocarp
In its current form BananaEndocarp is a script for interacting with MunkiWebAdmin2's API. We are using [@pudquick](https://github.com/pudquick)'s [nibbler](https://gist.github.com/pudquick/f27efd1ddcbf57be0d14031a5e692015).

This has been tested and works great with Imagr.


## Documentation 
Create an API user for use with mwa2. Modify `BananaEndocarp.py` [variables](https://github.com/clburlison/BananaEndocarp/blob/nibbler/BananaEndocarp.py#L36-L55). Run `make dmg`. Throw the the `launchBananaEndocarp.sh` script into your Imagr work along with changing the path to the dmg. Modify your imagr workflow. Benefit.


I owe you some better documentation...
