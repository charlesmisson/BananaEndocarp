# BananaEndocarp
In its current form BananaEndocarp is a dirty Tkinter script for interacting with MunkiWebAdmin2's API.

This was a dare to see if I could get it to work. Please don't use this in it's current form. Hopefully in the future I'll clean this up. If attempting to run in a AutoNBI or NBICreator NetInstall environment you will need to include the `Tcl` and `Tk` frameworks. See included `Tkinker_NetInstall_Frameworks` directory for assistance on packaging those frameworks.
